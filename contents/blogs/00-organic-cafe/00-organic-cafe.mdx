Text description provided by the architects. Density has always been a strong characteristic in the urban design of Hanoi. Historically horizontal concentration has been typical and more recently vertical construction has intensified the capital. Going against the trend of compressing building density, the Organic Caf√© plays with architectural contrasts to propose a resilient microcosm within the urban context.
